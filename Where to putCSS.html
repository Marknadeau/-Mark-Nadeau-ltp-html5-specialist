<!-- you can also make a link page by making a seperate page that is on the same document location (folder) as the html
it is done by copying the code like this
   h1  {
                color: #cc0000;
                font-size: 2em;
                font-family: sans-serif;
             }
            p  {
                font-family: monospace;
            }
make a style sheet called stylesheet and link it this way

<link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet">
this will make all code work after you delete <style></style>
